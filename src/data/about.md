Hello! I'm Vasco, a data science and machine learning enthusiast. I'm currently in the last year of my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at the University of Aveiro.

I consider myself as a goal-oriented person, always focused on a problem.

Driven by the desire of always being my better self, I choose to be in constant learning and having an open mind.

My mantra of life is all about hard work and absolute determination.
