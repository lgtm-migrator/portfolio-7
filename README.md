* I build my portfolio based on a customised gatsby starter from [cobidev](https://github.com/cobidev) named [gatsby-simplefolio](https://github.com/cobidev/gatsby-simplefolio)
* I draw a lot of design inspiration from [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7/) 4th version of her own portfolio which can be found [here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4)
