Hello! I'm Vasco Ramos, a 21-year-old student at the University of Minho, from the district of Viseu. I already graduated from my 3-year Bachelor's Degree in the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Aveiro, and I am currently taking my Mater's Degree in the same fields at the University of Minho.

I'm passionate about Databases, Software Engineering, Web and Micro Services, DevOps and Data Engineering.

During these years at the University of Aveiro, I always tried to enrich my academic path with other activities such as volunteer work and associativism within the university. With that in mind, I am a mentor to first-year students.

Furthermore, since my second year, I am part of an organization called <a href="http://aettua.pt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="AETTUA">AETTUA</a>, a non-profit youth association that aims to promote the most diverse activities for all students, teachers and employees of our department (<a href="https://www.ua.pt/deti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="DETI">DETI</a>).

With this experience, I had the chance to organize workshops, trips to a bunch of company's headquarters and job fairs. I consider this work one of the most important things I did during college because it allowed me to improve my social skills, such as teamwork and people management.

Driven by the desire of always being my better self, I choose to be in constant learning and having an open mind.

Lastly, I consider myself a goal-oriented person, always focused on a problem and my mantra of life is all about hard work and absolute determination.
